""" Aling Nena's Reward System Challenge
Author:
Description: This summer, Aling Nena’s Sari-sari store wants to implement a
reward system where customers can redeem a reward by texting the following:
<Reward number 1-9> <Customer’s name> <Gender f or m>

>> Please enter text: 1 nicole i. tibay f

The system will then reply the following:
Hi <Customer’s name first letters upper case>! You have successfully redeem
reward #<reward number> - <reward>! Thank you for choosing Aling Nena’s
Sari-sari store.

>> Hi Nicole I. Tibay! You have successfully redeem reward #1 - Coke sakto!
Thank you for choosing Aling Nena’s Sari-sari store.
